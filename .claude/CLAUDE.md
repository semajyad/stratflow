## vexp — Context-Aware AI Coding <!-- vexp v1.3.11 -->

vexp is a versioned tool (v1.3.11) for context-aware AI-assisted coding, providing intelligent code completion and suggestions based on project context. It is designed for developers and code reviewers to enhance productivity through repository-aware insights.

### MANDATORY: use vexp pipeline — do NOT grep or glob the codebase
For every task — bug fixes, features, refactors, debugging:
**call `run_pipeline` FIRST**. It executes context search + impact analysis +
memory recall in a single call, returning compressed results.

Do NOT use grep, glob, Bash, or cat to search/explore the codebase.
vexp returns pre-indexed, graph-ranked context that is more relevant and
uses fewer tokens than manual searching. Prefer `get_skeleton` over Read to
inspect files (detail: minimal/standard/detailed, 70-90% token savings).
Only use Read when you need exact raw content to edit a specific line.

### Primary Tool
- `run_pipeline` — **USE THIS FOR EVERYTHING**. Single call that runs
  capsule + impact + memory server-side. Returns compressed results.
  Auto-detects intent (debug/modify/refactor/explore) from your task.
  Includes full file content for pivots.
  Examples:
  - `run_pipeline({ "task": "fix JWT validation bug" })` — auto-detect
  - `run_pipeline({ "task": "refactor db layer", "preset": "refactor" })` — explicit
  - `run_pipeline({ "task": "add auth", "observation": "using JWT" })` — save insight in same call

### Other MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools (use only when run_pipeline is insufficient)
These are additional tools for specific use cases when the primary run_pipeline tool is not sufficient, such as lightweight queries or detailed impact analysis.
- `get_context_capsule` — lightweight alternative for simple questions only
- `get_impact_graph` — standalone deep impact analysis of a specific symbol
- `search_logic_flow` — trace execution paths between two specific symbols
- `get_skeleton` — **preferred over Read** for inspecting files (minimal/standard/detailed detail levels, 70-90% token savings)
- `index_status` — indexing status and health check
- `get_session_context` — recall observations from current/previous sessions
- `search_memory` — cross-session search for past decisions
- `save_observation` — persist insights (prefer using run_pipeline's observation param instead)

### Workflow
1. `run_pipeline({ "task": "your task" })` — ALWAYS FIRST. Returns pivots + impact + memories in 1 call
2. Need more detail on a file? Use `get_skeleton({ files: [...], detail: "detailed" })` — avoid Read unless editing
3. Make targeted changes based on the context returned
4. `run_pipeline` may be invoked again as a fresh call if you need additional context during implementation.
5. Do NOT chain multiple vexp/run_pipeline calls to simulate capsule+impact+memory+observation sequencing — one `run_pipeline` invocation should replace that whole chain and maintain its own isolated state.

### Subagent / Explore / Plan mode
- Subagents CAN and MUST call `run_pipeline` — always include the task description
- The PreToolUse hook blocks Grep/Glob when vexp daemon is running
- Do NOT spawn Agent(Explore) to freely search — call `run_pipeline` first,
  then pass the returned context into the agent prompt if needed
- Always: `run_pipeline` → get context → spawn agent with context

### Smart Features (automatic — no action needed)
- **Intent Detection**: auto-detects from your task keywords. "fix bug" → Debug, "refactor" → blast-radius, "add" → Modify
- **Hybrid Search**: keyword + semantic + graph centrality ranking
- **Session Memory**: auto-captures observations; memories auto-surfaced in results
- **LSP Bridge**: VS Code captures type-resolved call edges
- **Change Coupling**: co-changed files included as related context

### Advanced Parameters
- `preset: "debug"` — forces debug mode (capsule+tests+impact+memory)
- `preset: "refactor"` — deep impact analysis (depth 5)
- `max_tokens: 12000` — increase total budget for complex tasks
- `include_tests: true` — include test files in results
- `include_file_content: false` — omit full file content (lighter response)
